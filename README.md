iVotingd is an open-source implementation of the [iVoting](https://ivoting.us) node.

iVoting is an internet voting system using blockchain technology and strong cryptography to provide secure, anonymous, and verifiable voting over the network.

Our priorities within iVoting include:

* Security: We create a decentralized network with robust cryptographic measures to effectively protect voting results.
* Public Oversight: We introduce transparent protocol code under an open-source license (AGPLv3), allowing full control over the voting process, and independent counting of votes on each node
* Anonymity: We utilize identity concealment protocols like TOR and vote mixing to prevent linking voting results to individual identities.
* Increased Participation: By enabling voting from any location, introducing mobile or desktop voting enhances efficiency and convenience for decision-making in social groups.
* Auditability: A public blockchain ledger ensures anyone can verify the correctness of the voting process and results.

iVoting represents a step toward cyber-democracy, and our free application is available to all internet users interested in organizing electronic voting for social or recreational purposes.

iVoting and iVotingd was created by Smart Cables Sp. z o.o. in realization of Polish National Centre for Research and Development project POIR.01.01.01-00-0761/19 "System Blockchain iVote - zdecentralizowana sieć zaufania umożliwiająca bezpieczne, anonimowe, uczciwe głosowanie przez Internet z wykorzystaniem zaawansowanej kryptologii oraz publicznego rejestru" cofunded by European Fund of Regional Development.

iVoting system was applied as an European patent EP24172479.8 and Polish patent P.444711 both in process of verification.
